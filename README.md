# html-nav

Use this project to generate barebones html apps which allow you to navigate from one point to another using the host system's GPS. This can be helpful to people who use very basic "dumbphones" which may have a GPS and a very simple web browser, but no navigation app. This applies to a phone like the TCL FLIP Go.
